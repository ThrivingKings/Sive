A responsive design solution using javascript.

With more and more users visiting your site via a mobile device, responsive design is a must. The problem I've always had with responsive design is that I could never find a simple, easy to implement, solution that didn't require numerous custom @media queries through CSS. There's nothing wrong with the CSS approach, and it may even be "better" than this approach, but Sive is extremely simple and works in every browser.
